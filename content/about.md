San Diego Computer Society (SDCS) is a non-profit, tech-incubator for college students founded out of [San Diego Miramar College.](https://sdmiramar.edu)

We provide students access to workshops, professional resources and network enabling them to collaborate and solve real-world problems. We are the largest and most-rapidly growing student ran organization in San Diego.

We have taken teams of students to Hackathons, tech conferences, and hosted interviews of Tech-industry professionals in the form of a [live podcast](https://pubmix.site/pubcast), previously interviewing industry professionals (software engineers, database administrators, entrepreneurs, startup founders, astro-physicists, book authors etc.)

We host an [online forum](https://discord.gg/HMWFMAE3XQ) with over 350+ student members, which allows for students and teachers to connect, collaborate to work on different projects, share news, ideas and community opportunities such as internships, events and networking.

We offer workshops for students such as coding interview preparation, introduction to Linux programming, Basics of Git, and Amazon Web Services with San Diego Miramar College and Professor of Computer Science, Andrew Huang.

Our vision is uniting free-thinkers, self-starters alike and connect them to an ever-expanding network of peers, professionals, resources and opportunity towards their path to success.
