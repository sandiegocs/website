SDCS members and officers are welcome to join this GitHub organisation to
collaborate on projects and contribute to the `sandiegocs.net` website.

1. [Create a GitHub issue in this repository](https://github.com/sandiegocs/add-to-gh/issues/new)
2. Check your e-mail for an invitation or [view your invitation here.](https://github.com/orgs/sandiegocs/invitation)
3. Ping an Officer in the Discord server to get added to the `Members` and/or `Officers` teams. 

## Adding a member to their team (for officers)
Go to the respective team page ([members](https://github.com/orgs/sandiegocs/teams/members) or [officers](https://github.com/orgs/sandiegocs/teams/officers)). Select `Add a member` and put the username of the person mentioned. If you are adding an officer, ensure that they are in both the `@Officers` and `@Members` teams â€” permissions are heavily reliant on being within both to have proper access to repositories.
