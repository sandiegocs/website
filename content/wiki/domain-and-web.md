The `sandiegocs.net` domain is the official domain of SDCS. Sometimes, an officer may need to set DNS records to verify SDCS as the owner of the domain. We also have access to `sdcs.club` for link shortening. DNS and domain management is not handled by SDCS at this time â€” please contact Prof Andrew HUANG for more information.

## DNS and domain management
DNS is handled via Cloudflare with the primary custodial account [managed by Matthew RONCHETTO.](/~doamatto) Access to Cloudflare is granted upon request to any officer. For non-officers who need access to request a record change, contact an officer who has DNS access to make the record change on your behalf.

## Adding self to `/about`
The `/about` page contains a list of all the officers, alumni, advisors, and members the organisation has had. Individuals can add themselves to the list by appending themselves to the `/team.json` file in the site's source. A template is available below to guide adding oneself.
```js
"user": "your_username",
"name": "John Template", // optional
"bio": "Yes, I did invent templates", // optional
"portfolio": "https://abc.xyz", // optional
"linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/john-template" //optional
```

**For officers :** If you want to upload a photo, place a file called `your_username.jpg` in the `static/assets/team/` folder and it will automatically be loaded. Images should be no larger than 500 x 500 and should be less than 10 kilobytes in size (exceptions can be made if you have stubborn photos).
