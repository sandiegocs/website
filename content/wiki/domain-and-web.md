The `sandiegocs.net` domain is the official domain of SDCS. Sometimes, an officer may need to set DNS records to verify SDCS as the owner of the domain. We also have access to `sdcs.club` for link shortening.

## DNS and domain management
DNS and the `sandiegocs.net` domain is handled via Cloudflare with the primary custodial account [managed by Matthew RONCHETTO.](/~doamatto) Access to Cloudflare is granted upon request to any officer. For non-officers who need access to request a record change, contact an officer who has DNS access to make the record change on your behalf.

DNS and the `sdcs.club` domain is managed by Prof Andrew HUANG â€” contact them directly for more information.
