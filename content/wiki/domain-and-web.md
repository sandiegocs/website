The `sandiegocs.org` domain is the official domain of SDCS. Sometimes, an officer may need to set DNS records to verify SDCS as the owner of the domain.

## DNS and domain management
DNS is handled via Cloudflare with the primary custodial account managed by Matthew RONCHETTO. Access to Cloudflare is granted upon request to any officer. For non-officers who need access to request a record change, contact an officer who has DNS access to make the record change on your behalf.

## User pages
Each team member can create their own pages by creating a folder `/static/~username/`, where `username` is the username they specified in `/team.json`. All user-generated content will not be endorsed or supported by SDCS nor will SDCS be responsible for content posted by SDCS members. Officers will remove or modify data hosted by members if legally compelled to do so.
